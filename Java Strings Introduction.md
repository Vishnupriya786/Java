# Java Strings Introduction

## This exercise is to test your understanding of Java Strings. A sample String declaration:
## String myString = "Hello World!"
## The elements of a String are called characters. The number of characters in a String is called the length, and it can be retrieved with the String.length() method. Given two strings of lowercase English letters, a and b, perform the following operations:
## Sum the lengths of A and B.
## Determine if A is lexicographically larger than B (i.e.: does B come before A in the dictionary?).
## Capitalize the first letter in A and B and print them on a single line, separated by a space.
